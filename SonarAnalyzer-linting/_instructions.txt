1) add .editorconfig file to your project solution 

   - in Visual Studio (VS) go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Code Style > General
   - here click on "Generate .editorconfig file from settings" to auto create the file
   - the file should be placed in the same folder as project solution file (*.sln) 
   - confirm the file placement and VS should pop-up a yellow window with a question =>

     "A new .editorconfig file was detected at the root of your solution. Would you like
      to make it a solution item?"

   - choose "Yes" and "Solution Items" folder with the file should be in solution explorer

2) install SonarAnalyzer.CSharp NuGet Package (ver. 8.33.0.40503) => both project and tests

   - new Warnings should appear immediately after installation, if not, rebuild solution

3) customize linter behaviour according to your preferences by editing .editorconfig file

   - you can do it directly in VS by opening the file from solution explorer OR manually
     by making changes externally in notepad
